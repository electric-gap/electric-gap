# Electric Gap

### This is a work in progress... Hold on tight, we are having the conversations to get started and will be back here by the end of June 2021!

Electric Gap is an open source project that delivers accessible explanations to the complex and technological concepts we encounter in everyday life. Electric Gap aims to bridge the knowledge gap, through fun illustrations and memorable analogies that everyone is familiar with. It enables every person to understand the theories, technologies and ideas that are driving the world. 

The majority of society is left out from these conversations because of the inaccessible jargon used in the tech sector. This is why our motto is “Don’t believe what you are told, only believe what you understand”. By using analogies to everyday life situations (e.g. “algorithm” explained as a meal at a pizzeria) we aim at providing the non technical audience the tools to be able to join the conversation about the future of tech.
